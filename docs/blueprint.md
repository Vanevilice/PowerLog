# **App Name**: Logistics Calc

## Core Features:

- Data Input: Implement UI components for data input, such as fields for sea freight details and direct rail information.
- Excel Data Reading: Implement Excel data reading logic using libraries like xlsx.
- Data Parsing: Develop parsing logic to process the data read from Excel files into a structured format suitable for calculations.
- Calculation Logic: Create calculation logic to compute the total logistics costs for both sea freight and direct rail, based on the parsed data.
- Result Display: Generate and display the calculation results in a clear and understandable format, highlighting the cost differences between sea freight and direct rail.
- Code Structure: Implement modular project hierarchy, so there are no refactoring issues further.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a desaturated blue (#79A8D3) to evoke trust and stability, fitting for logistics.
- Background color: A light gray (#F0F4F8) will keep the focus on the data input fields.
- Accent color: Yellow-green (#B0E293) can indicate optimal routings or more cost-effective options in the calculation results.
- Use a clean, sans-serif font to ensure readability and a professional look.
- The layout should allow side-by-side comparison for cost differences of sea freight and direct rail
- Implement micro-interactions or transitions when loading and parsing data.
